ForTrilinos provides object-oriented Fortran interfaces to [Trilinos](http://github.com/Trilinos/Trilinos) C++ packages.

**This code contains the original implementation of the ForTrilinos interfaces developed prior to 2012. This code is no longer developed or maintained. The new ForTrilinos implementation using SWIG code generation procedures will be released later. The active development is currently done in the `develop` branch of the [repository](https://github.com/Trilinos/ForTrilinos).**
